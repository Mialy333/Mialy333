After an economic redundancy in 2023, I thought to get back to my prior business as Online Communication Strategist for Business Women and reach the next step.

The idea was clear: building a simple website to provide my services, showing testimonials and adding value for free by writing blog’s posts.

𝘉𝘶𝘵 𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦’𝘴 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘥 …

When I started to follow tutos on Youtube like « how to make you own Website ?», I felt more interested in coding than getting back to my own business! 

♦ 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗶𝗱 𝗜 𝗳𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗼𝘂𝘁?

1️⃣ Because I’d rather spending time getting frustrated until I found the solution in a time-unlimited period and that was ok.
2️⃣ Because I loved the process on how to be accurate on questions I asked to find the right answer and make sure I get exactly the result I want.

Those 2 signs led my decision to change. 

♦ 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗶𝗱 𝗜 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲?

First, I started to learn on my own following OpenClassrooms courses.
Then, I learned the best practice with expert Web Developers face-to-face from Monday to Friday at Ada Tech School during 𝟵 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵𝘀.
